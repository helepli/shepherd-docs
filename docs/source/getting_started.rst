Getting started: creating a Reinforcement Learning agent
========================================================

create user, user name, api key

create agent with an associated RL algorithm

 Several RL algorithms are supported by Shepherd, most of them are from the stable-baselienes 3 (link). We keep these algorithms up to date and add implementations of new RL algorithms.


parameters tuning?

distinction entre un shepherd agent et un stable baseline agent

you will always have a vety good agent because blabla TL
