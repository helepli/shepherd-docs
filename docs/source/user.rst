Shepherd user
=============

New users are added to the database by an internal staff member through the admin page. Standard information are needed for the user registration, such as a name, a password, and an email address. A User can possess more than one Shepherd Agent (one per environment that they have, or one per different algorithm on one environment to compare algorithms, for instance).
