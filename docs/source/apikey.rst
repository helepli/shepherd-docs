To avoid the need for a user name and password, we use generated **API keys** by the UUID module. The particularity of our usage of API keys is that one API key is also associated to one Shepherd Agent. When logging in to Shepherd, the client sends an API key to the server, which retrieves  the corresponding API key object, linked to the user's corresponding Agent. In the case where a user has multiple Shepherd agents, they would also have multiple API keys, one per agent. The advantage of this setting is that if one API key is leaked,  only one of the user's Shepherd Agents is leaked.
